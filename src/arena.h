 *  	`HOLE | 0x40 malloc(64) |`, searching for range [60, 70], this is most likely a buffer underflow
 *
 * # Example
 *
 * Consider this memory layout
 * `| 0x0 malloc(64) || 0x40 malloc(16) |`
 *  - If the search the range is [14, 16], then it will return the data allocated by the first malloc call()
 *  - However, if you search the range [60, 70], because it spans over two allocations, it will return NULL
